Currently we are trying to replicate this preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01769

## Installation

To create a conda environment that will run the notebooks:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate medical-v1
```
The `setup.sh` script lists the conda and pip commands to create this environment manually. To download the checkpoints and other data:
```bash
./download.sh
```

## Train DiffusionPrior

Train the prior model (see the file for all the command line arguments):

```bash
python train_prior.py
```

## Results

There are some training runs on wandb: https://wandb.ai/jimgoo/laion-fmri
